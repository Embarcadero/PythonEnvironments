Welcome to **PythonEnvironments**, a project designed to revolutionize the way Delphi developers integrate Python into their applications!  

🔗 **Why PythonEnvironments?**  
After more than two decades of introducing [Python4Delphi (P4D)](https://github.com/Embarcadero/Python4Delphi), we aim to solve the core challenge that inspired the P4D project in the first place. While P4D made it possible to use Python as a scripting engine for Delphi, its integration process was not always straightforward for the community.  

**PythonEnvironments** changes that by providing:  
✨ **Design-time components** to seamlessly embed Python environments into your Delphi applications.  
✨ Support for the readily-available Python embeddable package.  
✨ A smoother, hassle-free experience for developers!

## 🌟 Key Features  

✔️ **Simple Integration**: Embed Python effortlessly into your Delphi applications.  
✔️ **Multi-Version Support**: Compatible with Python `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`, and `3.13`.  
✔️ **Powered by Python4Delphi**: Leverages the robust capabilities of [P4D](https://github.com/Embarcadero/Python4Delphi).  
✔️ **Extends Python Ecosystem**: Use it with the [P4D Data Sciences Libraries](https://github.com/Embarcadero/P4D-Data-Sciences).
