After more than two decades of introducing [Python4Delphi (P4D)](https://github.com/Embarcadero/Python4Delphi)), we are trying to solve the essence of why the P4D project started with the **PythonEnvironments** project. Initially, P4D was designed to have a scripting capability in Delphi using Python. Python is a great programming language for prototyping and experimenting with an idea using short scripts. One of the reasons that the community didnâ€™t adopt to include Python into their Delphi applications as it was not an easy process to do so

**PythonEnvironments** provides a set of Design time Components to embed a desirable Python Environment into your Delphi application using the readily-available Python embeddable very easily. 

Please check out the [samples](https://github.com/Embarcadero/PythonEnviroments/tree/main/samples) section to Get Started on **PythonEnvironments**.

Currently we're providing support for Python versions - `3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9` and `3.10`. Support for `Python 3.11` is coming soon.

It is powered by [(P4D)](https://github.com/Embarcadero/Python4Delphi). It powers the [P4D Data Sciences Libraries](https://github.com/Embarcadero/P4D-Data-Sciences).

This is our first stable release. We encourage you to try it out, file bug reports, and add features. [Read more](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/?p=145025) and catch the recorded live stream.
